	Daigo &#34;Damian&#34; Minazuki (水無月 大悟 Minazuki Daigo) is a 23-year-old wolf who is cheerful, optimistic, and simple to the point of being ditzy—this, however, conceals his tragic past. After leaving his hometown, Rougetsu Village, Damian came to Asou City, working as a wage earner in Happy Street Mall. He hopes that he might spend his entire life surrounded by smiles and laughter, but wouldn&#39;t care if people didn&#39;t miss him if he was gone. However, as rumors start to spread of people in Asou City starting to go missing one after another,  Damian encounters a kobold-like creature. From that moment on, his life would never be the same again...<br><br><br>

	The Forest<br>Long ago, this area was a worshipping ground for an Avatar of Lust. Creatures of all sizes would travel great lengths to meet and engage in a multitude of crazy raunchy activities. This is how they’d pay their respects.<br>Over the years, the lust and general raunchiness slowed down. Eventually the rumors of the forest became just that.<br>But the critters that inhabit it remain frisky - albeit busy with their own lives. Can’t just sleep around all day, right? Got bills to pay, mouths to feed etc. <br>Of course, they’re more than happy to oblige the curious traveler…<br>The Critters<br>The forest is home to critters big and small. From a big ole’ bear, to teeny tiny mice, and everything in between. Of course, size and species didn’t stop them from being romantically involved~<br>The neighbors have a rich history with each other. There are lifelong partners and occasional flings. Some have drifted apart while others have yet to come together…<br>Aside from a unique personality, each of the critters have their own interests and kinks! There’s something for everyone here in the forest!<br>Be sure to talk with the neighbors often! They love to share their experiences, and they won’t skip the juicy details~.<br>The Love<br>Throughout the journey, our character will find themselves in a variety of promiscuous situations with the critters of the forest. He will be taking on many roles, experiencing many different kinks, receiving, and giving to the neighbors!<br>As our protagonist dives deeper into debauchery, the critters will be inspired and pursue flings of their own.<br>Who knows what your activities might awaken…<br><br><br>

	FixFox is a wholesome sci-fi adventure game. Play as Vix, an unlucky space mechanic, who crashlands on a mysterious planet where tools are forbidden. Accompanied by her trusty toolbox Tin, Vix travels across the planet Karamel discovering hidden stashes left by pirates, repairing friendly household appliances, and sampling tasty local delicacies.<br>EXPLORE AND DISCOVER<br>Traverse the planet on a peppy scooter, clear pathways with a hefty power loader, or simply go on a peaceful journey by foot to uncover all the landmarks on Karamel. Hum along to catchy chiptunes while discovering secret locations, testing your noggin on whimsical puzzles, and finally settling down for the night next to a toasty campfire looking up at the starry sky.<br>FIX AND BUILD<br>Repair machines with uplifting personalities such as a passionate lawn mower using unconventional tools like coins, bandages, glowy bananas… anything really. Live out a space mechanic’s dream by constructing and operating giant mechs to help out the local robots with their peculiar problems.  <br>EAT AND MAKE FRIENDS<br>Fixing things can be tough but ending the day with cozy food always makes it better. Enjoy delicious meals the planet dwellers have to offer such as homey soups, warm rice bowls, and totally-not-expired pudding. Making a friend over a meal with hospitable robots may just reveal a vital clue to solving your next quest.<br>FIX MORE THAN MACHINES<br>Starting with an unassuming beacon repair job Vix quickly finds herself mixed up in more than her own tale. An estranged brother looking for his long lost sibling, specialized artificial intelligences working through past traumas, and an ongoing feud between two planet factions are just a few of the tangled mysteries that need to be taken apart and fixed.<br>A WORLD BEYOND<br>In order to survive the global catastrophe of Earth’s cold atmosphere post climate change, mankind has genetically modified themselves to take on animal traits. The fur acquired from the genetic splicing helps humanity cope with the freezing weather and the ability to hibernate allows humans to sleep through long interstellar flights. This furry future is where the story of FixFox takes place.<br>A DREAM PRIOR<br>In the early 90s, my parents brought home our very first computer - the Polish knockoff of the Atari 8-bit. Using an old handbook, I learned how to code in Basic. From that moment, I wanted to dedicate my life to making games.<br>Fast forward to 2012, after visiting the Peace Memorial in Hiroshima and witnessing the consequences of violence and hatred, I made a personal vow to never play or make violent games. Instead, I focus on making games that promote kindness and friendship.  <br>With experience from game jams and heartwarming support from my friends and family, the dream of making this game has become a reality.<br>CREDITS<br>Fueled by my passion for wholesome stories, sci-fi, and adventure games, FixFox was designed, written, drawn, and programmed by me - Jaroslav Meloun.  <br>The music was composed and produced by the exceptionally talented Aleix Ramon.<br>The key art of Vix was created by the amazingly talented Jana Kilianová.<br>My wish is for YOUR dream to come true, just like mine!<br><br><br>

<title>The Use of Life</title>

	<img width='360' height='168' src='../assets/The_Use_of_Life/thumbnail.jpg?hc=uquery&t=1653765240' alt='' loading='lazy'><br><br>
	The Use of Life is a “game book”-style multi-ending RPG.<br><br>Scenarios with changing conclusions in The Use of Life<br>In this game the main character’s various “attachments” fluctuate in accordance with the choices the player makes, changing the character’s way of thinking. The ending you experience changes depending on “the use of life” you choose through your journey.<br>Will the main character uses their “life” for their own good, or for the benefit of others? This all depends on the decisions and choices you make as the player. The game’s ending represents the natural conclusion of the way this life was lived, and there is no “good ending” or “bad ending”.<br><br>Tense battles based on the theme of “stillness and motion”<br>The battles in this title are characterized by a fusion of &#34;command-style battle strategy&#34; and &#34;QTE action&#34;.<br>With both sides acting three times per turn, the player must work out &#34;How will I handle the enemy&#39;s powerful attacks?&#34;, and &#34;How will I execute a devastating blow?&#34; Victory will be determined by your skills and strategies.<br>This is a game in which even if you aren’t able to defeat an enemy at first, you will learn how to fight them appropriately and win after a few tries. For the boss battles in particular, we aim to create a game where you can overcome the tension of “life or death” and enjoy a sense of accomplishment once you’ve defeated a powerful enemy.<br><br>”Game book”-style events<br>In this game, events proceed with a unique game book-style narration, sometimes using TRPG-like dice rolls to decide outcomes as various events unfold.<br>Even contents of the same event can change based on the various actions you take, the decisions you make, and their outcomes.<br>It is up to you as the player to decide whether to play it safe and proceed with caution, or to go full-on and throw yourself into battle with reckless abandon.<br>These actions will also affect the way the main character thinks.<br><br>Character customization<br>The main character, having acquired power via a certain curse, is able to enhance any skill of his choosing by coming into contact with “death”. The success rate of each event will change depending on which abilities are more honed, which will greatly affect not only battles but also normal events.<br>Additionally, various skills can be learned by increasing his level and upgrading his class.<br>----------------------------------------------------------------<br>・The &#34;Fighter&#34; carves up enemies with pure physical attack power and a high number of moves<br>・The &#34;Samurai&#34; unleashes unabashed power for fierce critical strikes<br>・The &#34;Mage&#34; specializes in high-risk, high-reward super-firepower using magical chants<br>・The &#34;Sorcerer&#34; toys with their opponent by utilizing special attacks such as status ailments<br>----------------------------------------------------------------<br>Myriad fighting styles can be utilized depending on the class you choose to upgrade.<br><br>A “good new” type of JRPG<br>While this title is technically a JRPG, we are not aiming for a &#34;good old JRPG&#34; style, but rather a &#34;good &#39;new&#39; JRPG&#34; style, in hopes of showing that this kind of evolution is absolutely possible.<br><br>■Early Access Ver. Features<br>①Play even further through the story than the trial version.<br>②The Early Access version is for the purpose of making the game more fun to play.<br>In Early Access, developers can experiment by implementing elements they&#39;d like to try out, and then using the feedback received from users to develop/improve the full version.<br>③Players who have purchased the Early Access version will be able to receive and switch to the full version upon completion and release.<br>④Since it&#39;s cheaper than the full version, it&#39;s a better deal than purchasing the game after official release.<br><br><br>

	Corruption of Champions II (or CoC2 for short) is a text-based adventure game in which you contend with an invasion of perverse demons into your home realm, all the while romancing hot monstergirls (and furries, orcs, elves, demons, and all sorts of other cuties) and transforming yourself into your ideal physical form. CoC2 is a game about customization, letting you play whatever kind of character you want: whether you&#39;re a busty bimbo bandit or a chiseled lupine barbarian; a hermaphroditic cowgirl sorceress specialized in milk-magic, or a burly orc warpriest who intimidates his companions back into the fight.<br><br>No matter what you choose to transform yourself into, you&#39;ll be accompanied on your perverse adventures by a group of eclectic companions, from catgirl clerics and kitsune sorceresses, to chastity-caged elf dickgirls and domineering orc amazons. You can lead two of these companions at a time against a world full of lustful enemies and corrupted magics, building up your party and your own Champion&#39;s talents to bring to bear countless combinations of strengths and weaknesses against your demonic foes.<br><br><br>

<title>Lenin - The Lion</title>
<description><![CDATA[
	<img width='360' height='168' src='../assets/Lenin_The_Lion/thumbnail.jpg?hc=uquery&t=1647583997' alt='' loading='lazy'><br><br>
	Synopsis<br>Lenin is an albino lion, the only one of his kind, and because of that he feels insecure and constantly discouraged. Worse, his mother does not understand why his son was born this way, and the whole village despises him and treats him cruelly. At school, he suffers bullying and can’t concentrate on class.<br>Now, hopeless about life, certain situations seem to awaken in Lenin something that is not of everyone’s reality, but only of his. Something he will discover to be part of something else.<br>Besides, Lenin will find other animals species , which may help him to understand himself.<br>However, things are getting dangerous and Lenin needs to take care with his actions (your actions).<br>Traveling between daily life and a strange place, Lenin will have to face his inner fears and enemies – and often, the outer ones as well.<br>Gameplay<br>Lenin - The Lion is like a typical aerial-view RPGs of the SNES or Gameboy Color classics. The difference here is given by some criteria:<br><br>There are no battles or levels: all actions taken by the player are through conversations with NPC&#39;s, puzzles and varied options.<br>There is always more than one choice to proceed: yes, though many games work with &#34;moral choices&#34;, in Lenin - The Lion choices don&#39;t change the character profile, but how is the unfolding of the main plot. With this in mind, don&#39;t expect multiple paths inside of the same part of the story. Your actions change the FUTURE scenes of the game, as well the endings of each area, unlocking new conversations with NPC&#39;s and different endings for the game as a whole.<br><br>Features<br><br>A teenager&#39;s world and his struggles.<br>No battle systems or levels.<br>Lenin’s backpack is his menu. Losing it means not having access to the menu.<br>Items and puzzles are crucial in the interactions between Lenin and the others.<br>Choices determine the different endings of the game.<br>Original art / soundtrack.<br>Anthropomorphized characters.<br>A cute and unique main character ❤<br><br><br><br>
